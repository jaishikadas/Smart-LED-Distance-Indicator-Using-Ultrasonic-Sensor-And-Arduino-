🔹 Project Details: Smart LED Distance Indicator using Ultrasonic Sensor and Arduino
📌 Introduction
This project is a real-time distance indicator using an HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor and LEDs to visually represent object proximity. It is designed to provide intuitive feedback for applications like smart parking, obstacle detection, and assistive devices for visually impaired individuals.

🎯 Objectives
✔️ Develop a low-cost and efficient distance measurement system.
✔️ Provide real-time feedback using LEDs.
✔️ Improve safety and automation in various applications.
✔️ Make the system easy to understand and implement.

🛠️ Components Used
🔹 Arduino Uno – Microcontroller for processing sensor data.
🔹 HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor – Measures distance using sound waves.
🔹 LEDs (5x) – Visual indicators for different distance ranges.
🔹 Resistors (220Ω each) – Limits current to LEDs for safe operation.
🔹 Jumper Wires – Connects all components.

⚙️ Working Principle
1️⃣ The HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor emits sound waves that bounce off objects and return.
2️⃣ The Arduino Uno calculates the distance based on the time delay of the returning waves.
3️⃣ The system lights up LEDs progressively based on the detected distance:
    • Distance ≥ 15 cm → No LEDs ON (Safe) 
    • 12 cm ≤ Distance < 15 cm → 1 LED ON 
    • 9 cm ≤ Distance < 12 cm → 2 LEDs ON 
    • 6 cm ≤ Distance < 9 cm → 3 LEDs ON 
    • 3 cm ≤ Distance < 6 cm → 4 LEDs ON 
    • Distance < 3 cm → All 5 LEDs ON (Danger) 
4️⃣ The system continuously updates the LED status in real time.

📌 Circuit Connection Guide
✔️ HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor:
    • VCC → 5V (Arduino) 
    • GND → GND (Arduino) 
    • Trig → Pin 6 (Arduino) 
    • Echo → Pin 7 (Arduino)
